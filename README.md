# planet-challenge

- I used Angular and Spring and PostgreSql as the database.
- I implemented the requirements to view all the planets in the solar system.
- To add a new planet, click on the "Add New Planet" button.  
- To change the status of a planet, click on that planet and then in the first combo box it will change.  
- To send a crew to a planet, click on that planet and in the second combo box, select that crew.  
- For the bonus, for the authentication part I did the frontend authentication part with token bearer but I didn't manage to implement on the backend part, I would have needed more time.
